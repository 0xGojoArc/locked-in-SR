 ###### [[ABI]]
 -  Application Binary Interface
 - Contracts interface specified in standard so that they cant interact with each other
 - This is critical for both outside the blockchain, when Tx triggered targeting destination contract but also for msgs that are sent between 2 or more contracts within the EVM context
 - These Interface functions are strongly typed, known at compilation and static type
 - types of function parameter are well known at compile time
